### **Overview:**

A VM (Virtual Machine) is a virtualized environment created within a physical machine, dividing it into multiple independent virtual machines. Each VM can be configured with its own allocated computational and memory resources. Within each VM, a separate operating system and applications can be installed. This allows for multiple isolated software environments to meet different usage requirements.

### **Use Cases:**

- Isolated Environments: When there is a larger server available and multiple smaller computing needs that require independent operation.
- Cloud Migration: When migrating from on-premises to the cloud, but the existing architecture cannot be containerized or requires the installation of non-containerizable software.
- Vertical Scaling: When there is a need to dynamically adjust the computational resources of the operating environment based on usage requirements.
- Horizontal Scaling: Through VM image mechanisms, VMs can be quickly deployed to other machines.
- System Restoration: Quick system restoration can be achieved through VM image mechanisms.

### **Disadvantages:**

- Resource Intensive: Compared to lightweight containerization technologies, each VM requires an operating system, resulting in higher resource usage.
- Slow Startup: Each VM has its own operating system, leading to slower boot times.
- Costly: Additional VM management systems or licenses are often required to utilize the full VM functionality, resulting in higher costs.
- Difficult Horizontal Scaling: Scaling VMs can be challenging, especially for large-scale deployment and management of multiple VMs. Adjustments need to be made to individual VM configurations, network settings, and other attributes, requiring additional time and effort.
