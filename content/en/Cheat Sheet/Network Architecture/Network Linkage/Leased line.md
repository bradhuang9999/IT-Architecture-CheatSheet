### Description

Leased line is a type of WAN connection option. It is a dedicated network provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) with a fixed bandwidth, allowing for secure communication without going through the internet. Leased lines are used to connect different areas of data centers or subnets.

### Use Cases

- Securely connecting different subnets in separate areas.
- Securely connecting to services from cloud providers.

### Advantages

- Security: Leased lines establish secure communication between different internal networks without relying on the internet.
- Stable Speed: ISPs provide a fixed bandwidth based on the signed contract, ensuring consistent speed without sharing with others.

### Disadvantages

- High Cost: Leased lines provided by ISPs are billed based on the bandwidth, which is typically expensive.
- Single Point of Failure: There is a risk of failure in a single leased line network, so multiple leased lines are usually configured as backups.
