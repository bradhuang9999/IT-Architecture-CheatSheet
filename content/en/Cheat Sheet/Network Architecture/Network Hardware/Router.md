### Description

A router is a network device that maintains a routing table, which records the information about which port to forward network packets to which device based on different IP ranges. When receiving a network packet, the router forwards it according to the rules in its routing table.

### Use Cases

- Segregation of internal and external networks: By utilizing routing tables and features like Network Address Translation (NAT), routers connect internal networks to external networks, enabling communication between them.
- Segregation of different subnets: Routers are commonly used to divide subnets and forward packets to the corresponding switches based on rules, facilitating communication between different subnets.
- Integration of NAT, VPN, firewall, and other features: Modern routers often integrate multiple advanced features such as NAT, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and firewalls. This simplifies network architecture and reduces the number of required devices. However, this approach offers less flexibility and availability. In large enterprise networks, separate devices are typically used for each function.

### Advantages

- Subnet segmentation: Router-based subnet segmentation enhances network security and improves communication efficiency among smaller subnets.

### Disadvantages

- Higher cost: Compared to switches and hubs, routers tend to be more expensive, especially those with advanced features like NAT and firewalls.
- Complexity in management: Managing router routing tables and other configurations can be complex, involving multiple factors. Planning and managing routers in large networks require specialized knowledge and experience.
- Performance limitation: Routers handle significant network traffic between internal and external networks, which may limit the performance of individual routers. It is recommended to enhance network performance through load balancing and other strategies.
