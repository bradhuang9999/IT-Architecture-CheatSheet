### Description

A modem is a device used to convert the analog signals provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) into digital network signals for internal networks, and vice versa. The network signals from the ISP can be in various forms such as fiber optic, telephone signals (DSL), cable television signals (Cable), and more, requiring the corresponding type of modem for conversion. Modems can also perform packet integrity verification, data compression, and other functions. Some advanced modems are capable of supporting multiple external signals or have router functionality.

### Use Cases

- Connecting personal computers or internal networks to the external network.
