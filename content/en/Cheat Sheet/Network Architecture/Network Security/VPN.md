### **Description**

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) establishes a secure encrypted connection over a public network, protecting the communication between users and servers from being intercepted by malicious third parties.

### **Advantages**

- Enables secure communication between multiple private networks in different locations, allowing interconnectedness between network environments from various regions.
- Provides remote workers a secure way to connect to a private network, enabling them to remotely access internal resources and perform their work.
- Offers an additional layer of security protection for network applications, safeguarding the confidentiality of sensitive data and communications.

### **Disadvantages**

- The encryption and decryption processes require computational resources, which can potentially slow down transmission speeds.
- VPN technology is more complex and requires additional networking equipment, resulting in higher management and setup costs.
- VPN infrastructure is vulnerable to network attacks such as DDoS, necessitating appropriate security measures to protect the availability and stability of the VPN.
