### **Description**

Databases often store a large amount of data, and if query statements are not optimized, it can result in slow query speeds, causing user dissatisfaction and excessive consumption of system resources. Therefore, when dealing with large amounts of data, it is important to focus on query optimization.

### **Common Practices**

- Timely creation and usage of indexes: Creating data indexes can speed up query performance. However, index creation requires additional storage space, and different databases have different index selection logic. Improper index creation may result in queries not being able to use indexes.
- Viewing SQL execution plans: By examining the indexes and resource status used by SQL statements, it is possible to understand the actual execution method of the current query, which helps in optimizing the query statement.
- Careful use of hints: Hints can be used to specify index usage, but this feature should be used with caution, as the database should be able to automatically choose the appropriate index.
- Creating summary files: If frequently retrieving data after aggregation, consider pre-generating summary files to reduce the computational workload of queries.
- Using advanced features such as partitioning, sharding, and pagination: Based on specific needs, consider using advanced features like partitioning or pagination to optimize query efficiency.
- Monitoring and analyzing database performance: Monitor SQL statements that consume significant system resources and attempt to optimize high-load SQL queries.
