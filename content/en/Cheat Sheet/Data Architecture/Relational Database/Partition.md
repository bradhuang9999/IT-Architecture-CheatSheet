### **Description**

Partitioning is a method of dividing a massive database table into multiple partitions stored on different hard drives or disk arrays within the same server. The partitioning is done based on criteria such as time, letters, numbers, or hash values, which are specified as the partition key.

### **Use Cases**

- When a single database table becomes excessively large, and there is a clear and available partition key.
- When there is a need to distribute the burden of a large table across multiple disks within a single server.

### **Advantages**

- Query performance optimization: Data queries can be distributed across multiple hard drives, improving query performance.
- Simplified architecture: It does not require complex distributed multi-server database management structures.

### **Disadvantages**

- Single point of failure: If a single partition or server experiences a failure, the data within that partition becomes inaccessible.
- Risk of data imbalance: Improper design of the partition key can result in an uneven distribution of data, leading to some disks being underutilized.
- Management complexity: Considerations such as cross-partition queries, data consistency, backup, and fault recovery need to be addressed.
