### **Description**

Block Storage is a method of storing a large amount of data by distributing it across multiple servers in individual blocks of data. It allows for both sequential and random file access and can store structured and related sets of files.

### **Use Cases**

- Shared folders within an enterprise.
- Data folders mounted by virtual machines (VMs) or containers.

### **Advantages**

- Storage of large amounts of files: Block Storage can handle high-capacity storage requirements through horizontal scaling.
- Storage of structured files: Block Storage supports storage of structured data, such as relational databases.

### **Disadvantages**

- Complex architecture and management: Block Storage requires more configuration and management, including block allocation and access control.
- High setup cost: Establishing and maintaining Block Storage typically involves significant costs, including hardware equipment, storage software, and data protection.
