### **Description**

Network Attached Storage (NAS) is a standalone file access server that connects hard drives to the network.

### **Use Cases**

- Shared disk storage for enterprises.
- Multiple servers accessing the same disk space.

### **Advantages**

- Multiple servers can access the data simultaneously.
- Supports mounting multiple hard drives, providing larger storage capacity.
- With mechanisms like RAID, it can reduce the risk of data loss due to a single drive failure.

### **Disadvantages**

- Higher cost: Compared to DAS, NAS requires a separate server and multiple hard drives, resulting in higher costs.
- Complex architecture and management: NAS requires management of servers, networking, and storage configurations, making it more challenging to manage.
- Single point of failure: If the NAS server experiences a network or power interruption, it will be unable to provide data access services.
