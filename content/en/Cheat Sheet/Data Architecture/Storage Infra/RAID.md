### **Description**

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a technology that utilizes multiple disks to redundantly store data, reducing the risk of data loss due to a single disk failure. There are various levels of RAID, such as RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 6, each with different redundancy logic and backup methods. RAID can be implemented through hardware or software.

### **Use Cases**

- Data storage with important data where the goal is to avoid data loss caused by a single disk failure.

### **Advantages**

- Redundant protection: Reduces the risk of data loss by storing data across multiple disks with redundancy.
- High read/write efficiency: With multiple disks, simultaneous reading and writing to different disks can improve overall performance.

### **Disadvantages**

- Higher cost: Different RAID levels may require additional redundant disks, and specialized RAID disk arrays may need to be purchased.
- Complex management: RAID requires consideration of different RAID levels and storage configurations.
- Potential decrease in write speed: In certain RAID modes, simultaneous writing to multiple disks may result in decreased write speed.
- Inability to address localized risks: RAID alone cannot protect against localized risks such as power outages or natural disasters that may cause data loss.
