### **Description**

A Storage Area Network (SAN) utilizes a dedicated fiber network, multiple disk arrays, and multiple switches to form a storage space. Although it consists of multiple disk arrays, it can be mounted and used by servers just like regular hard drives. SAN addresses the risk of single point of failure found in NAS and provides faster access speed, but it comes with a significantly higher price.

### **Use Cases**

- Shared disk storage and server usage in large enterprises.

### **Advantages**

- Eliminates single point of failure: Multiple disk arrays are available for access, preventing connectivity issues caused by a single disk array failure.
- Fast access: SAN utilizes fiber optics to access data, resulting in faster access speed.
- Does not consume LAN traffic: SAN uses a dedicated network for data access, ensuring other LAN services are unaffected.
- Easy scalability: With multiple disk arrays, storage capacity can be increased in batches without impacting service operation.

### **Disadvantages**

- Significantly higher cost: SAN requires multiple disk arrays and fiber network infrastructure, resulting in higher expenses.
- Complex management: SAN requires additional management of disk array devices and maintenance of fiber network configurations, making it complex to manage with a steep learning curve.
