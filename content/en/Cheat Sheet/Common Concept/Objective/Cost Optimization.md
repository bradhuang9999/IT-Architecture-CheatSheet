### **Description**

Cost is a crucial consideration when designing an architecture. Typically, higher-level services require higher costs. For example, although a lower Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is desirable, achieving a lower RTO often comes with higher costs. Therefore, it's important to carefully assess the required service level and optimize costs.

### **Accurately Calculating Costs**

Due to the different nature of costs, it is more precise to calculate them separately as follows:

- Capital Expenditure (CapEx): The initial cost of purchasing equipment, services, and setup.
- Operating Expenditure (OpEx): The ongoing cost of maintaining equipment and services, including personnel expenses.

### **Other Cost Optimization Methods**

- Use of cloud services: Leveraging cloud services and utilizing a pay-as-you-go pricing model is a common way to optimize costs.
- Horizontal auto-scaling: Dynamically allocating system resources based on usage requirements can reduce redundant provisioning.
- Monitor resource utilization and optimize resource allocation.
