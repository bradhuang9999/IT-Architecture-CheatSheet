### **Description**

Depending on the organization's location and industry, there are usually different compliance requirements. Violating compliance requirements can result in fines and negatively impact the organization's reputation. When designing an architecture, it is important to carefully identify the scope of compliance requirements that need to be followed. This helps to avoid additional time and cost for making changes after the architecture design.

Possible compliance requirements include the GDPR personal data requirements in the European Union, as well as specific compliance requirements in the finance and healthcare industries. Additionally, there are regulations in various regions regarding the geographical location where data can be stored.
