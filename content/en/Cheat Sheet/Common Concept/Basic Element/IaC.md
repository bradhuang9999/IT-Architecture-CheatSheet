### **Description**

IaC (Infrastructure as Code) is a method of documenting the configuration requirements of infrastructure by writing code. With specific tools, this code can be deployed to multiple devices and changes can be made to the device state, achieving the goal of rapid deployment. There are generally two types of code that can be used to implement IaC: one describes the desired changes, and the other describes the desired system state.

### **Advantages**

- Rapid management: Allows for quick deployment and management of the state of multiple servers.
- Easy understanding of changes: The expected changes are documented in the code.
- Change traceability: Relevant change history is recorded in the version control system.

### **Disadvantages**

- Higher complexity in setting up IaC.
- Learning curve: Due to the complexity of the code and tools involved, it requires a longer learning time.

### **Examples**

- Anisble
- Puppet
- Terraform
- Docker
- AWS CloudFormation
- Google Cloud Deployment Manager
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
