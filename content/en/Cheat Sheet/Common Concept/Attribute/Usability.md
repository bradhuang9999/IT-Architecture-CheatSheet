### **Description**

When designing a system, it should be made as user-friendly as possible to reduce the frustration of unfamiliar users during their initial usage and minimize unnecessary actions. This helps attract a larger customer base and generate more profit.

### **Possible Approaches**

- Designing an intuitive user experience (UX): Good UX design can help users quickly get started and improve efficiency. This includes intuitive interface design, consistent workflows, and clear instructions.
- Reducing application size and network requirements: Efforts should be made to minimize the size of the application to improve download speed and runtime efficiency. Additionally, reducing network requirements can decrease latency and instability experienced by users during usage.
- Considering accessibility design: In addition to typical users, attention should also be given to users with different physical abilities. Following accessibility design principles, such as providing readable text, clear labels, and keyboard navigation, ensures that all users can easily access and use the system.
- Multilingual user interface: Considering users from different regions, providing a multilingual user interface enhances their user experience. This design reduces language barriers and ensures that global users can understand and operate the system effortlessly.
