### **Description**

An extensible software and system architecture helps retain flexibility for future enhancements. It avoids the need for major architectural changes when adjusting the system to meet future requirements.

### **Common Practices**

- Consider future changes: During the design phase, proactively think about possible future developments, including adding, modifying, or removing functionalities, to preserve system flexibility. This can be achieved through thorough requirements analysis and design planning.
- Modular design and low coupling: Divide the system into independent modules and ensure low coupling between them. This allows for the addition or replacement of functionalities by adjusting the respective modules, without the need for extensive changes to the entire system. Additionally, provide standardized interfaces or APIs to facilitate the implementation of new functionalities within the same interface, further enhancing system extensibility.
