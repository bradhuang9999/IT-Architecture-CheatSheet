### **Description**

The architecture design takes into consideration the variability in system usage and aims to facilitate scalability based on different requirements. An easily scalable system can be adjusted in real-time according to the demands. When the system experiences high demand, resources can be increased to handle the workload efficiently. Conversely, when the demand is low, resources can be reduced to save costs. Scalability needs to be considered in various aspects of the system, including computing power, file and database access, network traffic, and more.

### **Common Practices**

- Demand planning: Assess the current usage and predict future growth and special events to determine the scaling design of the system.
- Vertical scaling: Adding more system resources to a single server. Scaling speed is slower, and the scalability is relatively limited.
- Horizontal scaling: Scaling the system across multiple servers. Scaling speed is faster, and the scalability is greater.
- Automatic scaling: Dynamically detecting the system's demand and automatically scaling resources accordingly.
