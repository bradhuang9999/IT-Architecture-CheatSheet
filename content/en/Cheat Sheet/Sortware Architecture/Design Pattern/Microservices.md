### **Description**

Microservices is a software architecture pattern that involves breaking down a large system into smaller modules to achieve a loosely coupled system architecture. Each microservice has its own independent business logic and connects to its own database. Communication between microservices is typically done through lightweight protocols like HTTP.

### **Use Cases**

- Complex large-scale systems aiming to reduce coupling.
- Systems that require flexible horizontal scalability.

### **Advantages**

- Reduced coupling: By splitting the system into different services, direct internal calls are avoided, resulting in reduced coupling.
- Easy horizontal scalability: Since each system can have independent containers, additional containers can be dynamically deployed to handle high traffic demands.
- Technology independence: Different services can use different software architectures and technology choices based on their specific requirements.

### **Disadvantages**

- Inability to directly cross-call systems: Once split into different services, direct invocation of business logic across services is not possible.
- Increased network traffic: Communication between microservices relies on network communication, which may increase network traffic requirements.
- Complex deployment and maintenance: Splitting into multiple services requires independent deployment, and managing them becomes more complex as they need to monitor traffic demands and dynamically scale.
