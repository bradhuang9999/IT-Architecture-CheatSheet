### **Description**

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a website security mechanism used to restrict certain types of unsafe behaviors on web pages. By defining a security policy for web content, CSP can adjust the security settings for various behaviors on the web page, including restrictions on resource loading sources, allowance of inline JavaScript and CSS, and limiting requests to HTTPS only.

### **Advantages**

- Reduces the likelihood of browsers executing risky actions, minimizing security risks.

### **Disadvantages**

- Requires understanding the nuances of different configuration settings, making it complex to set up.
- CSP rules need careful design and testing to ensure they do not adversely affect the normal functioning of website features, especially for existing website functionalities that use higher-risk behaviors (such as inline CSS).
