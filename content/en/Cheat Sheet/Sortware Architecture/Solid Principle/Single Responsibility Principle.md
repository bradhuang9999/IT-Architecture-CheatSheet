### **Description**

A piece of code, such as a class, interface, or function, should be responsible for a single responsibility in order to reduce code coupling and improve readability, maintainability, and testability.

### **Example**

In a book ordering system, functions such as order management, order accuracy checking, and database operations for orders should be separated into different classes.
