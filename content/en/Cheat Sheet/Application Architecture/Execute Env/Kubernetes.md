### **Overview:**

Kubernetes is a tool for large-scale deployment and container orchestration.

Its main functionalities include:

- Container orchestration: Grouping related containers into pods, which can have separate network configurations.
- Container deployment: Automated container deployment based on server load or scheduling. When servers can't accommodate more containers, additional servers are automatically launched.
- High availability: Automatic replacement of failed containers or servers.
- Network management: Assigning unique IP addresses and network segregation to each container.
- Service discovery: Distributing traffic to appropriate containers using load balancing, as multiple instances of the same container are spread across servers.
- Deployment management: Integration with CI/CD for various deployment management and testing methods, such as canary deployment or A/B testing.

### **Use Cases:**

- Managing container services in distributed environments with thousands of servers.
- Managing container services in multi-region and hybrid cloud environments.

### **Disadvantages:**

- Complexity in configuration: Due to the management of thousands of servers, network and container-related configurations can be complex.
- Steep learning curve: With many abstract concepts like pods, services, and ingress, and various configurations affecting the container cluster, it requires significant time for learning.
- Resource consumption: Monitoring and managing containers require considerable system resources.
