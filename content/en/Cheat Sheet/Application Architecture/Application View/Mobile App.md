### **Overview:**

A mobile application is a specialized software application designed to be installed on a mobile device, usually downloaded from an application store. Different operating systems have different default development frameworks, requiring separate development approaches or the use of cross-platform frameworks such as React Native or Flutter.

## **Advantages:**

- Convenience and ease of use: Mobile applications can be directly installed from an application store without the need for additional downloads or entering URLs. Additionally, the interfaces are often optimized for mobile usage.
- High supportability: Once granted user permissions, mobile applications can fully utilize various hardware features and access system information on the device.
- Offline usability: Most mobile applications can function offline unless network features are required.

## **Disadvantages:**

- High development costs: Separate development is needed for iOS and Android, and multiple versions of devices from different manufacturers need to be tested.
- Compatibility issues with older devices: Consideration must be given to the limited software and hardware support on older models of mobile devices, as some users may still be using them.
