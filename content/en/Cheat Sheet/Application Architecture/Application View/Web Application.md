### **Overview:**

Web applications are accessed through a browser to directly use the application on a website.

### **Advantages:**

- No Installation Required: Unlike traditional standalone applications that require installation, web applications can be accessed simply by connecting to a website through a browser.
- Version Synchronization: When connecting to a web application, the latest version is always used, avoiding issues caused by version inconsistencies.
- Cross-Platform Usage: Web applications can be accessed using standard browsers, eliminating compatibility issues across different types and versions of computers.
- Low Client-Side Load: Most of the computation is performed on the server-side.

### **Disadvantages:**

- Security: Connecting to web applications over public networks introduces more cybersecurity risks, such as XSS, SQL injection, CSRF attacks.
- Complexity: Web applications are divided into frontend components responsible for display and backend components handling business logic, making the overall process more abstract and complex.
- Browser Version Issues: Different users may have different browser versions installed, requiring consideration for browser compatibility.
- No Offline Usage: Web applications cannot be used when there is no internet connection. Modern Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) address this issue by caching data.
- Network Speed Issues: Some clients may have unstable internet speeds, which can affect performance. Techniques such as caching and reducing/delaying network requests need to be considered.
- Limitations on Software and Hardware Access: Due to browser support and security concerns, web applications cannot access all hardware information and user files in the same way as native applications.
