### **Overview:**

Batch programs are a set of server-side programs that can be executed on a scheduled, manual, or event-triggered basis. They are commonly used for performing predefined tasks such as data conversion, report generation, and data validation.

### **Use Cases:**

- Data conversion, validation, and report generation.
- Actions that require a longer execution time.
- Actions that need to be performed on a scheduled basis.

### **Disadvantages:**

- Resource consumption: Batch programs that require longer execution times often consume more system resources.
- Complexity of scheduling system: Since multiple batch programs can be queued in different queues, and each program may have different priorities and execution times, improper design can lead to job congestion.
- Delayed results: Batch data conversion processes do not provide real-time results, and the converted data may not be immediately vis
