	<h3 id="description"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>Efficiency is one of the objectives in architectural design. An efficient architecture can enhance user satisfaction, generate more revenue, and enable businesses to respond quickly to external changes.</p>
<p>Possible approaches include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choosing the right tools based on understanding the system&rsquo;s characteristics. Each tool is designed for specific situations, and selecting the correct tool can significantly increase system efficiency. For example, if it is known that the system needs real-time statistics of product sales on a website, using a columnar database in high-volume sales scenarios is often more efficient than traditional relational databases.</li>
<li>Performing computations at the appropriate location and time. For instance, avoiding large-scale computations on the user&rsquo;s device or the website server, as browsers typically have limited system resources and website servers need to serve a large number of users. Instead, performing extensive computations through Stream Data Pipelines for analysis or using batch processing in batch programs.</li>
<li>Horizontal auto-scaling: Automatically scaling the number of servers based on system load to accommodate increased resource demands.</li>
<li>Optimizing computational logic: Designing suitable algorithms based on understanding the computational requirements, which can significantly reduce redundant computations and improve system performance.</li>
<li>Caching computation results: Caching time-consuming or network-dependent computation results. By retrieving results from server-side or cache servers, redundant computations and unnecessary network requests can be avoided.</li>

<p>The low coupling of a system refers to the low degree of interdependence between modules. In large-scale systems, the system is often divided into multiple modules based on their functionality, such as an order module and a user information module. Although these modules may need to collaborate with each other, it is important to minimize direct dependencies between modules for better management. This helps prevent excessive coupling, making it easier to make changes to individual modules without causing significant impacts on others.</p>
<h3 id="different-types-of-coupling-ranked-from-low-to-high"><strong>Different types of coupling ranked from low to high:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Content coupling: Directly accessing another module&rsquo;s internal data, such as using variables or directly reading another module&rsquo;s data tables.</li>
<li>External coupling: Both modules read and write to a global data location.</li>
<li>Control coupling: Providing an interface to the other module, allowing Module B to control Module A through this interface while encapsulating its own data and processes.</li>
<li>Message coupling: Providing an external messaging interface for invocation, such as calling through a Web API.</li>

	<h3 id="overview"><strong>Overview:</strong></h3>
<p>What are the omissions or errors in the following description of Message Queue?
A Message Queue is a commonly used mechanism for asynchronous processing of logic. When a service requires a longer time to complete, to avoid upstream waiting, the service request can be placed in a queue and executed in order. Multiple service consumers will retrieve service requests from the queue and perform the corresponding processing.</p>
<p>A typical Message Queue architecture consists of three main components: the Message producer (role responsible for generating service requests), the Message consumer (role responsible for processing service requests), and the Message broker (role responsible for message sorting and calling consumers).</p>
<p>By using a Message Queue, we can achieve one-to-many communication. The producer does not need to know how many consumers there are; as long as there are consumers registered for the corresponding events, they will receive the messages. This design pattern effectively decouples the direct dependency between the producer and consumer, making the system more flexible and scalable.</p>
<p>By appropriately applying Message Queue, we can improve system reliability and performance, especially in scenarios that involve asynchronous processing requirements.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases"><strong>Use Cases:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous event-driven operations</li>
<li>Asynchronous communication</li>
<li>Log processing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages"><strong>Advantages:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid front-end waiting: Once the producer sends the message request, it can complete the action.</li>
<li>Loose coupling: A large service can be broken down into multiple loosely coupled smaller services. These services do not need to communicate directly; the requests are passed through the broker.</li>
<li>Scalability: When there are many pending requests, more consumers can be dynamically added to handle the service requests.</li>
<li>Parallel processing: If multiple consumers are registered for the same event, the event processing can be done synchronously, without the need for sequential execution.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages"><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Inability to know results in real-time: As messages need to wait for the broker to forward them, if the producer needs to wait for the result, it needs to track the processing status of the message.</li>

<p>If a subclass is not designed according to the Liskov Substitution Principle, other parts of the program may encounter errors because they may not know the specific implementation of the superclass and expect consistent behavior. Therefore, a subclass should maintain the same behavior as the superclass and only provide additional details or extensions.

	<h3 id="description"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that when designing components, it is important to avoid directly instantiating objects with different implementation details within the component to handle different calling requirements. Instead, the component should depend on abstractions by specifying the interfaces that can be passed in from external sources. This approach helps reduce coupling between code components.</p>
<p>There are two specific ways to implement the Dependency Inversion Principle:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dependency Injection: Components specify interfaces to be injected during design. When using the component, the functionality is dynamically determined by the injected interface implementation.</li>
<li>Dependency Lookup: Utilizing container management mechanisms like Spring, the container can dynamically provide the required concrete implementations of classes when needed.</li>

	<h3 id="description"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. To achieve this principle, various approaches can be used, such as inheritance, polymorphism, or design patterns.</p>
<p>Specifically, there are several common ways to adhere to the Open-Closed Principle:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inheritance: Subclasses can inherit the existing functionality from the parent class and override the differing parts. Implementing interfaces can also achieve similar results.</li>
<li>Polymorphism: The same method can have different implementations based on different input values. By adding different input values to handle different cases, existing methods can be extended without modification.</li>
<li>Design patterns offer classic solutions for flexible design. For example, the Builder pattern provides a flexible way to create objects, the Decorator pattern allows dynamic addition of additional functionality, and the Dependency Injection pattern separates variable logic into independent interfaces, implementing different behaviors based on the injected interface.</li>

<p>If there is a need to access resources from other domains, it can be achieved through Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) or JSONP. CORS allows other domains to access resources by adding the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the response. JSONP bypasses the same-origin policy restriction by loading a script tag in HTML.</p>

	<h3 id="description"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a common website security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious code into a website. By injecting this code, attackers can execute it when users browse the website, achieving their malicious goals such as redirecting users to other websites or stealing user-entered information.</p>
<h3 id="three-types-of-xss"><strong>Three Types of XSS</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Reflected XSS: Malicious code is injected into the backend through user-controlled data, such as URL parameters, cookies, or form inputs. The backend then returns this data directly to the frontend, causing the malicious code to be executed when users view the web page.</li>
<li>Stored XSS: Malicious code is stored in a database. When data is retrieved from the database and rendered on the frontend, the malicious code is executed.</li>
<li>DOM-based XSS: Malicious code is returned to the frontend through methods like Ajax. The frontend directly inserts the malicious code into the DOM structure of the page, resulting in the execution of the malicious code.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preventing-xss"><strong>Preventing XSS</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of content on web pages, preventing the injection and execution of malicious code.</li>
<li>Perform HTML encoding on data outputted to the web page to ensure that risky content is not displayed, preventing the execution of malicious code.</li>
<li>Validate and filter input data transmitted to the backend to prevent the use and storage of risky content.</li>
<li>Regularly conduct black-box penetration testing and white-box source code scanning on the website to ensure there are no security vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

	<h3 id="description"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack method that exploits the authenticated session of a user on a website to perform malicious actions on a targeted website.</p>
<h3 id="attack-scenario"><strong>Attack Scenario</strong></h3>
<p>Background: The user is already logged in to the targeted website, and the browser has the website&rsquo;s cookies stored.</p>
<p>Attack: The user visits a malicious website that contains an image or hyperlink. When the user interacts with the image or hyperlink, it triggers a request to the targeted website with malicious content. Since the request carries the correct cookies, the targeted website trusts the request and becomes vulnerable to the attack.</p>
<h3 id="prevention-methods"><strong>Prevention Methods</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>The server-side should check whether the Origin or Referer in the request headers matches the domain of the targeted website. If they don&rsquo;t match, the server should reject the request.</li>
<li>When generating web pages, the server-side should generate a random CSRF token and store it in the user&rsquo;s session instead of cookies. Each time a request is received, the server-side should verify if the CSRF token in the request matches the one stored in the user&rsquo;s session to ensure the request comes from the correct webpage.</li>

	<h3 id="description"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>Microservices is a software architecture pattern that involves breaking down a large system into smaller modules to achieve a loosely coupled system architecture. Each microservice has its own independent business logic and connects to its own database. Communication between microservices is typically done through lightweight protocols like HTTP.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases"><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Complex large-scale systems aiming to reduce coupling.</li>
<li>Systems that require flexible horizontal scalability.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages"><strong>Advantages</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduced coupling: By splitting the system into different services, direct internal calls are avoided, resulting in reduced coupling.</li>
<li>Easy horizontal scalability: Since each system can have independent containers, additional containers can be dynamically deployed to handle high traffic demands.</li>
<li>Technology independence: Different services can use different software architectures and technology choices based on their specific requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Inability to directly cross-call systems: Once split into different services, direct invocation of business logic across services is not possible.</li>
<li>Increased network traffic: Communication between microservices relies on network communication, which may increase network traffic requirements.</li>
<li>Complex deployment and maintenance: Splitting into multiple services requires independent deployment, and managing them becomes more complex as they need to monitor traffic demands and dynamically scale.</li>

	<h3 id="description"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>Event-driven pattern is a programming design pattern where events are registered and specific logic is associated with the occurrence of each event. In this pattern, the event handling logic is decoupled from the event triggering points, eliminating the need to directly specify the location of event triggers in the code. Instead, event registration and triggering systems are used to dynamically connect event triggers with their corresponding handling logic.</p>
<h3 id="advantages"><strong>Advantages</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Decoupling: Event handling logic is decoupled from event triggers, resulting in a more flexible and maintainable code structure.</li>
<li>Asynchrony: Event triggers can quickly respond to users without waiting for the completion of event handling logic, improving system responsiveness.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Unclear flow: Since event registration and triggering systems dynamically call event handling logic, it may be challenging to understand and trace the subsequent event flow.</li>
<li>Difficult transaction control: As event handling logics are independent from each other, it is difficult to track and control the results of previous event handling stages within a specific event handling logic.</li>
<li>Performance impact: The system&rsquo;s performance may be affected due to the dynamic triggering and processing of a large number of events. Proper design and management of event registration are necessary to avoid performance issues.</li>

	<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>A hub enables communication among multiple devices in a local area network. Its operation is straightforward as it simply broadcasts any received packet to all other devices connected to the same hub. However, due to its limitation of transmitting only one device&rsquo;s packet at a time, hubs are less commonly used unless there is a need to connect only a few devices.</p>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Affordable price: Hubs have a simple design, resulting in lower device costs.</li>
<li>Easy setup: No configuration is required on the hub itself; devices can communicate with each other as long as their IP addresses do not conflict.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Limited simultaneous device connections: The fixed broadcast nature of hubs can lead to packet collisions, as only one packet can be transmitted at a time.</li>
<li>Lower security: Due to the fixed broadcast of packets, other devices connected to the hub receive the packet content, making it possible for unauthorized parties to listen in on the packet content.</li>

	<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>A switch, similar to a hub, allows multiple devices in a local area network to communicate with each other by transmitting packets. However, a switch differs from a hub in that it records the MAC addresses of devices connected to its ports in an internal MAC table, enabling precise packet forwarding to the intended destination device.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Packet forwarding: Utilizes the MAC table to accurately deliver packets to the target device.</li>
<li>Broadcast MAC address lookup: If an unknown MAC address is encountered, the switch broadcasts to find the corresponding device.</li>
<li>MAC table maintenance: Updates the MAC table when a device is found, a MAC address changes, or a port is closed.</li>
<li>Provides interface for configuration: Offers interfaces for administrators to manually adjust the MAC table or configure subnet-to-port mappings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Required in a local area network where multiple devices need to communicate with each other.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduced network traffic: Precise packet forwarding using the MAC table results in lower packet volume, reducing overall network traffic.</li>
<li>Supports multiple device connections: Without packet collisions, the switch can facilitate simultaneous data exchange among multiple devices.</li>
<li>Enhanced security: Prevents packet delivery to unintended recipients, reducing the risk of eavesdropping.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Higher cost: Switches are more expensive compared to hubs due to their complex structure.</li>
<li>Complexity in usage: Managing network segmentation and the MAC table requires understanding of specific requirements.</li>
<li>Single point of failure: If a single switch in the network fails, it can cause connectivity issues for the devices connected to it. This can be mitigated by implementing load balancing or redundancy measures.</li>

	<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>A router is a network device that maintains a routing table, which records the information about which port to forward network packets to which device based on different IP ranges. When receiving a network packet, the router forwards it according to the rules in its routing table.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Segregation of internal and external networks: By utilizing routing tables and features like Network Address Translation (NAT), routers connect internal networks to external networks, enabling communication between them.</li>
<li>Segregation of different subnets: Routers are commonly used to divide subnets and forward packets to the corresponding switches based on rules, facilitating communication between different subnets.</li>
<li>Integration of NAT, VPN, firewall, and other features: Modern routers often integrate multiple advanced features such as NAT, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and firewalls. This simplifies network architecture and reduces the number of required devices. However, this approach offers less flexibility and availability. In large enterprise networks, separate devices are typically used for each function.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Subnet segmentation: Router-based subnet segmentation enhances network security and improves communication efficiency among smaller subnets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Higher cost: Compared to switches and hubs, routers tend to be more expensive, especially those with advanced features like NAT and firewalls.</li>
<li>Complexity in management: Managing router routing tables and other configurations can be complex, involving multiple factors. Planning and managing routers in large networks require specialized knowledge and experience.</li>
<li>Performance limitation: Routers handle significant network traffic between internal and external networks, which may limit the performance of individual routers. It is recommended to enhance network performance through load balancing and other strategies.</li>

	<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>NAT (Network Address Translation) is a technique performed on the firewall, router, or dedicated NAT server in an edge network to translate packets between internal and external devices. It converts internal IP addresses into one or more public IP addresses to prevent external malicious entities from identifying the list of devices in the internal network through IP addresses. When a response is received, NAT determines which internal device to send the response to based on information such as the requested URL or port.</p>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced security for internal networks: NAT masks the internal IP addresses at the edge network, making it impossible for external devices to identify the list of devices in the internal network or directly call internal devices through IP addresses.</li>
<li>Conservation of public IP addresses: NAT allows a large number of internal devices to connect to the internet using a small pool of public IP addresses, reducing the required number of public IP addresses and associated costs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increased complexity of network architecture: All packets connecting to the external network need to pass through NAT for forwarding and translation, which adds complexity to the network architecture.</li>
<li>Impact on network speed: Since all packets connecting to the external network must go through NAT, having only one NAT server may potentially reduce the connection speed to the external network. This issue can be mitigated by horizontally scaling multiple NAT servers.</li>
</ul>

	<h3 id="description"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) aims to protect the communication security and data integrity between network entities through the use of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics"><strong>Characteristics</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>HTTPS utilizes a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption for transmission, ensuring data security and efficiency. Asymmetric encryption is used for establishing secure connections and performing authentication, while symmetric encryption is used for encrypting transmitted data.</li>
<li>URLs in HTTPS begin with &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and, by default, use port 443 instead of the default port 80 used by HTTP. This configuration helps differentiate between regular HTTP connections and secure HTTPS connections.</li>
<li>When using HTTPS on the internet, it requires obtaining digital certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). These certificates are used to verify the identity of servers, ensuring communication encryption and authenticity. In private internal networks, self-signed certificates can be used but need to be pre-installed and trusted on each device.</li>
<li>The primary purpose of HTTPS is to protect the confidentiality and integrity of communication content. Through the use of the TLS protocol, it provides end-to-end encryption, ensuring data security during transmission. However, HTTPS does not fully protect against other types of attacks, such as DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks and malware. Therefore, a comprehensive security strategy should include additional security measures like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="handshake-process"><strong>Handshake Process</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Application Stage:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The website generates a website public key (site.pub) and a website private key (site.key).</li>
<li>Using the website private key and website information, a certificate signing request (CSR) file (site.csr) is created and provided to a Certificate Authority (CA).</li>
<li>After verifying the identity, the CA signs the CSR content with its private key, generating a website certificate (site.crt).</li>
<li>The website certificate is provided to the website administration.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Handshake Stage:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The browser requests a HTTPS connection with the website, and the website provides its website certificate (server.crt).</li>
<li>The certificate&rsquo;s validity, including its dates and other certificate data, is checked.</li>
<li>If the certificate&rsquo;s issuer is a CA trusted by the browser, the browser uses the CA&rsquo;s public key stored in its memory to decrypt the signature in server.crt. If successful, it means the certificate was issued by a trusted CA. The decrypted signature hash value is obtained.</li>
<li>The data specified by the signature is hashed using the hash algorithm specified in the signature to generate a hash value, which is compared to the original hash value attached to the signature. If they match, it confirms that the data hasn&rsquo;t been tampered with.</li>
<li>A symmetric encryption key is generated for encryption and encrypted using the website&rsquo;s public key from site.crt. The encrypted key is then sent to the website.</li>
<li>The website decrypts the encrypted key using its private key, obtaining the symmetric encryption key.</li>
<li>At this stage, both parties have completed authentication and securely exchanged the symmetric encryption key.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Communication Stage:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The browser encrypts the request using the symmetric encryption key, and the server decrypts it using the same key.</li>
<li>The server encrypts the response using the symmetric encryption key, and the browser decrypts it using the same key.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Alice first provides Bob with a large prime number, denoted as &ldquo;p,&rdquo; and a smaller exponent, denoted as &ldquo;g,&rdquo; to be used for calculations.</li>
<li>Both Alice and Bob generate secret numbers, denoted as &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;b&rdquo; respectively, which are kept private and not transmitted over the network.</li>
<li>Alice computes the public value A = (g^a) mod p and shares it with Bob.</li>
<li>Bob computes the public value B = (g^b) mod p and shares it with Alice.</li>
<li>Alice uses the public value B provided by Bob and her own secret number a to compute the key K = (B^a) mod p.</li>
<li>Bob uses the public value A provided by Alice and his own secret number b to compute the key K = (A^b) mod p.</li>

<p>Databases often store a large amount of data, and if query statements are not optimized, it can result in slow query speeds, causing user dissatisfaction and excessive consumption of system resources. Therefore, when dealing with large amounts of data, it is important to focus on query optimization.</p>
<h3 id="common-practices"><strong>Common Practices</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Timely creation and usage of indexes: Creating data indexes can speed up query performance. However, index creation requires additional storage space, and different databases have different index selection logic. Improper index creation may result in queries not being able to use indexes.</li>
<li>Viewing SQL execution plans: By examining the indexes and resource status used by SQL statements, it is possible to understand the actual execution method of the current query, which helps in optimizing the query statement.</li>
<li>Careful use of hints: Hints can be used to specify index usage, but this feature should be used with caution, as the database should be able to automatically choose the appropriate index.</li>
<li>Creating summary files: If frequently retrieving data after aggregation, consider pre-generating summary files to reduce the computational workload of queries.</li>
<li>Using advanced features such as partitioning, sharding, and pagination: Based on specific needs, consider using advanced features like partitioning or pagination to optimize query efficiency.</li>

	<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Columnar database stores data in columns, allowing for quick retrieval of specific columns for analysis. For example, in sales data with multiple detail columns, such as product ID and sales amount, these columns are stored separately. To retrieve the sales amount for a specific product, one only needs to scan the product ID column and find the corresponding row index. Then, using that row index, the corresponding value in the sales amount column can be filtered to obtain the sales amount for that product. Since unused columns are stored separately, data retrieval is faster compared to traditional row-based databases.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Real-time big data analytics systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fast aggregation of specific columns: With separate storage for each column, it allows for quick retrieval of aggregated data for each column.</li>
<li>Fast writes: Compared to traditional OLAP databases, data can be stored in real-time across different columns, fulfilling the requirements of real-time big data analytics.</li>
<li>Easy horizontal scalability: Since data is stored separately for each column, it can be stored on different servers, improving availability.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Efficiency may be lower when aggregating multiple columns compared to traditional row-based databases.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

	<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Graph database is specifically designed to record the relationships between a large amount of data. The data is represented as nodes, and the relationships between nodes are represented as edges. By defining the start point, end point, direction, and properties of edges, a graph database can quickly find relevant nodes based on a specific node, even when dealing with a large number of edges. To improve query speed, indexes are commonly created for frequently used edges.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Social networking websites: Utilizing friend relationships as edges to recommend friends of friends. Using shared interests as edges to recommend users with similar hobbies.</li>
<li>Recommendation engines: Finding related recommended products or videos based on browsing history, purchase records, user preferences, and other relationships.</li>
<li>Fraud detection: Identifying potential fraud risks by analyzing transaction information such as payment recipients, addresses, and phone numbers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fast querying of relationships between objects: Even with millions of relationship data, a graph database can perform queries quickly.</li>
<li>Flexible data model: It allows for the customization of various forms of nodes and edges based on business requirements.</li>
<li>Built-in graph algorithms: Graph databases typically come with various built-in graph algorithms, enabling users to execute algorithmic queries related to relationship data easily.</li>
<li>Easy horizontal scalability: Graph databases are designed to handle the demands of billions of relationship data commonly found in large-scale websites. They can be easily scaled across multiple servers to meet the needs of high-volume relationship operations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Highly specialized: Graph databases focus on storing and querying the relationships between objects. If detailed information about related objects (such as product details) is required, it often needs to be combined with other databases.</li>
<li>Requires significant storage space: Due to the often complex relationships between nodes and the need for indexes to improve query performance, more storage space is required.</li>
<li>High learning curve: The query language and data model of graph databases differ from traditional SQL, requiring additional time and effort to learn.</li>

	<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Key-Value Database stores data using keys as the index for data retrieval, without requiring a predefined data format for each record. Since each data record is independent, Key-Value Databases can efficiently store a massive amount of data while horizontally scaling.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data caching: Key-Value Databases can be used to cache data, allowing for quick access to recent data.</li>
<li>Stateless servers: Moving user session states from web servers to Key-Value Databases enables horizontal scalability and server replacement without losing user data, increasing website availability.</li>
<li>Shopping cart data: Storing user shopping cart data in a Key-Value Database can alleviate the burden on relational databases during peak periods and prevent data loss due to a high volume of service requests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flexible data storage format: Each data record is stored independently without requiring a predefined format.</li>
<li>Fast data retrieval: With the knowledge of the key, data can be quickly accessed.</li>
<li>Horizontal scalability: The independent nature of each key-value pair makes horizontal scaling easier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Limited computational operations across keys: Key-Value Databases primarily support simple aggregation calculations based on keys. For complex aggregation calculations, other types of databases are recommended.</li>

<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Personal or small-scale systems</li>
<li>Tolerable longer RPO (Recovery Point Objective, the acceptable data loss interval in the event of system failure)</li>
<li>Tolerable longer RTO (Recovery Time Objective, the time required for system recovery)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Simple architecture: Only requires setting up scheduled backups and storing them in another location.</li>
<li>Cost-effective: Does not require additional server activation, resulting in lower costs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Longer RPO: Since cold backups are typically generated at longer intervals (e.g., once a day), there may be a longer data loss window in the event of a system failure.</li>

	<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Warm backup involves setting up a dedicated standby server that is already installed with relevant services and regularly updated. It also loads the latest backup data. Under normal circumstances, the standby server is not operational, and the system does not read from or modify it. Only when the primary server fails, the standby server is activated and the differential data is loaded to provide system services. The RTO (Recovery Time Objective) for warm backup typically ranges from a few hours to a few days.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<p>Warm backup is suitable for small-scale internal systems that aim to recover services within a few hours.</p>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lower RPO: Since the standby server regularly loads the latest backup data, less data is lost in the event of a failure.</li>
<li>Lower RTO: Because the backup data is already loaded into the standby server, service can be quickly started by making configuration modifications. Additionally, RTO time can be further reduced through automatic failover modes such as fault detection.</li>
<li>Simple architecture: There is no need to consider data synchronization in a multi-site architecture, reducing architectural complexity.</li>
<li>Lower cost: Only an additional standby server is required. In cloud architecture, fewer system resources can be used during normal operation. When switching to the standby server, more system resources can be obtained through vertical scaling. With the pay-as-you-go model offered by the cloud, costs can be effectively controlled.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>RPO still exists: Since the data is backed up periodically, there may still be a time gap between the latest backup and the occurrence of a failure.</li>
<li>Higher cost: An additional standby server is required, along with the cost of keeping the standby server ready for activation. If automatic fault detection and failover are required, additional costs may be incurred.</li>

	<h3 id="description"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>Hot backup refers to the real-time synchronization of data to another backup server. When the primary server fails, the backup server stops receiving synchronized data, becomes the primary server, and modifies other service configurations to connect to this backup server.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases"><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Desire to reduce RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) without overly complex architecture and with reasonable backup costs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages"><strong>Advantages</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Lower RPO: Since data is typically synchronized in milliseconds or seconds, less data is lost under normal circumstances.</li>
<li>Lower RTO: Because the backup data is already loaded into the backup server, service can be quickly started by making configuration modifications. Automatic switching can even be performed through fault detection modes.</li>
<li>Simple architecture: There is no need to consider data synchronization in a multi-site architecture.</li>
<li>Lower cost: Only an additional backup server is required. In cloud architecture, fewer system resources can be used during normal operation.

<p>Multi-site is a design pattern for achieving high data availability, where multiple servers synchronize data with each other and provide system services. When any server fails, the service on that server is automatically stopped, and other servers take over to support system demands. There are various modes to achieve a multi-site architecture, such as using a primary server for data writes and a backup server for data reads, or employing a server cluster to coordinate multiple servers for service provision.</p>

<ul>
<li>Enterprises seeking to provide a highly available architecture.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minimal RPO and RTO: With real-time synchronization and automatic failover, high availability can be achieved.</li>
<li>System responsiveness: Having multiple servers serving requests reduces the workload on individual servers, enhancing user satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>

	<h3 id="description"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>Asymmetric encryption is a cryptographic technique that, unlike symmetric encryption, uses a pair of keys, including a public key and a private key, for encryption and decryption operations.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works: A pair of public and private keys is generated. The public key can be distributed to others over the network, while the private key must be kept secret and not transmitted over the internet. During the encryption process, the sender uses the private key to encrypt the data or create a digital signature. The receiver, upon receiving the encrypted data, uses the public key to decrypt it or verify the signature. If the decryption or verification is successful, it confirms that the data indeed comes from the corresponding private key and has not been tampered with during transmission.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases"><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> Used to verify the authenticity and integrity of files or data, preventing forgery or tampering.</li>
<li><strong>Message Encryption:</strong> Used to protect sensitive information during network transmission, where only the private key holder can decrypt and read the content.</li>
<li><strong>HTTPS Communication:</strong> Used to encrypt the transmission data of websites, ensuring privacy and security during communication.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Transmission of Symmetric Encryption Keys:</strong> In symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption algorithms can be used to securely transmit the symmetric encryption key, ensuring it remains confidential during transmission.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages"><strong>Advantages</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Security:</strong> The private key is not transmitted over the network, and only the private key holder can decrypt or sign the data, providing higher security.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Key Exchange:</strong> Can be used for secure exchange of symmetric encryption algorithm keys, enhancing the overall system security.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slower Encryption/Decryption Speed:</strong> Asymmetric encryption algorithms are more complex compared to symmetric encryption, requiring more time to complete encryption and decryption operations.</li>
